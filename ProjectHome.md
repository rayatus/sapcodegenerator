Some usefull stuff that generates ABAP code automatically in order to develop some utilities, for example:
  * Data Base layer encapsulation (ZDBFRAMEWORK): generates ABAP Clases with methods as GET\_DETAIL (more or less to SELECT\_SINGLE using buffer technique) and GET\_LIST to encapsulate DBSelects. You can also generate SAVE/UPDATE/DELETE methods
