# sapcodegenerator

Some usefull stuff that generates ABAP code automatically in order to develop some utilities, for example: 
- Data Base layer encapsulation (ZDBFRAMEWORK): generates ABAP Clases with methods as GET_DETAIL (more or less to SELECT_SINGLE using buffer technique) and GET_LIST to encapsulate DBSelects. You can also generate SAVE/UPDATE/DELETE methods
